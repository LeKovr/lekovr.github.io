I am a programmer, but I do not write to order. I'm not so much interested in software as I'm concerned about how satisfied users are with this software. If you need to attract (or replace) coders or admins for this - this experience I have. But my main motivation is to make this world better.

I'm looking for a business that needs such a specialist.
