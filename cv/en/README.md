Since 2015, the preferred programming language has changed from perl to golang. From now on everything that is not sql and bash, I write on golang. I am interested in participating in a large project in this language.

Since 2006 I work remotely on a full time basis and would prefer to keep this mode. For offline, Stavropol and Krasnodar are currently available.
